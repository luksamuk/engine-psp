* About

Luksamuk's Engine (PSP Edition)

* Important notice

This project  uses a somewhat modified  version of [[https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs][FLECS]] that  compiles with the
PSP development toolchain. Modifications were  necessary since the PSP toolchain
is not exactly POSIX-compliant.
